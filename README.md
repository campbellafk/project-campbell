# How to install "project campbell"


# Infomation

Please do not use the program maliciously. This program is intended to be used for educational purposes only. Project Campbell is only used to demonstrate what type of information attackers can grab from a user's computer. This is a project was created to make it easier for malware analysts or ordinary users to understand how credential grabbing works and can be used for analysis, research, reverse engineering, or review.

What is malware?

    Malware is a term that is used for malicious software that is designed to do damage or unwanted actions to a computer system.

An explanation of this tool:

Google Chrome always store user data in the same place, so the stealer generated by Project Campbell has no problem in finding it. In theory at least, this data is stored in encrypted form. However, if the malware has already penetrated the system, then its actions are done in your name.

Therefore, the malware simply finds a way to decrypt information stored on your computer (by making it seem like thie user is requesting it) . The stealer gets all your passwords and cookies.

The tool is also able to find Roblox cookies that are stored in the Windows Registry. By running the malicious .exe file, it is able to search for the Roblox cookie. The same goes for Minecraft sessions, Discord tokens, etc since it is stored in the user's computer.

Recommended tools for testing Project Campbell: (when running the produced output after building)

    Virtualbox
    VMware
    Process Hacker
    VirusTotal

Tips to check if an exe file is safe:

    Analyze the file with VirusTotal
    Check if the exe file has a publisher
    Check it in a sandbox
    Monitor the fileâ€™s network activity for strange behavior
